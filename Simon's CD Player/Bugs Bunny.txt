What's up Doc?

Simon's Proverb: "If I fix every bugs in this version then how do I release next version?"

Known Bugs:

1)When the CD door is opened by clicking eject button of CD-ROM and then try to close it by eject button of Simon's CD Player. The button has to be clicked twice.

2)Random Order and Intro Play do not work simultaneously.

3)In the "Preferences" dialog box, the two check boxes; Save Settings on Exit  & Show Tool Tips, saves settings and shows tooltips where they are checked or not 'Coz I haven't written any code to stop them from doing so.

To Do Lists:
1)Many things are yet to be implemented.
